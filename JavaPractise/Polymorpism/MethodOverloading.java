//WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

//driver.get("https://example.com"); get() is defined in WebDriver, but ChromeDriver overrides it to provide specific functionality for Chrome. Thatâ€™s polymorphism via overriding in action.
//Static, constructors, and private methods cannot be overridden.
//Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
